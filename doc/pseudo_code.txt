Get DT_~ (Todo: add details here :) ).

Perform breadth-first search on the unfolding of DT_~ (unfold on demand) and label states as follows:
    - label fixed points as successful
    - label bad states as unsuccessful
    - label states with no successors as dead
    - otherwise: compute successors in the tree

Afterwards: label bottom-up: successful and dead nodes are marked with TRUE, unsuccessful nodes with FALSE. For internal nodes: if all successors are labelled with TRUE, label with TRUE, otherwise with FALSE (Todo: revise this, I am not 100% sure aboute the ALL successors).

If the root is labeled with TRUE, there exists a winning strategy.
